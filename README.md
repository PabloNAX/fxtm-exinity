## Before launching

Flutter version 3.24.5


The freezed and mockito generated code should be first run with build_runner:

`dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs && flutter pub get`

you can change the api keys or prod/mock env in .env file. 

I added .env and generated files (.freezed, .g) to github for the sake of the time.
